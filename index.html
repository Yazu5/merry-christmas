  <h1>To You</h1>

  <!-- 
Merry Christmas, Ehriel.
 this letter will be long, so i ask that you take your time reading it. i am not writing this in haste or impulse. every word here comes from careful thought and reflection. christmas has always been a season of honesty for me. it brings out truths that are usually kept quiet. tonight, those truths led me to write to you. this letter is written with respect and sincerity.
i hope that as you read this, you are well and at peace. i hope life has been gentle with you lately. christmas lights and quiet nights tend to remind us of people who mattered. it is during moments like this that memories resurface naturally. i am not writing to disrupt your life. i simply want to express what has been living in my heart. this letter is not a demand, but a confession. it is meant to be read slowly and gently.
i still remember how we first met, and how simple it was. nag chat lang ako sayo noon sa tiktok, nothing more than a small conversation. there were no expectations on my part at that time. i did not imagine that moment would lead to something meaningful. it felt ordinary then, almost forgettable. yet somehow, that moment became important. from that small beginning, a connection started to form. i did not realize how much it would matter later on.
as time passed, we became friends. i was comfortable with that and accepted it fully. i genuinely thought hanggang doon na lang talaga tayo. i did not want to assume or hope for more. i told myself to be content with what we had. there was peace in that acceptance. still, my heart quietly felt something deeper. i kept those feelings to myself for a long time. i did not want to disrupt what was already good.
despite having no hope, i found myself praying. i prayed not out of entitlement, but out of sincerity. i asked God quietly and humbly. i prayed that maybe one day, you would feel the same. i prayed for a chance, even a small one. i knew there was no guarantee. still, i trusted God with that desire. i placed that hope in his hands completely.
in time, God answered that prayer. what happened between us felt like grace to me. it felt like something i did not earn but was given. because of that, i chose to put God at the center of our relationship. i believed that faith would guide us and protect what we had. i wanted us to be grounded in something greater than ourselves. i trusted that with God, things would last. i held onto that belief strongly. it was important to me.
however, not everything is perfect, and i understand that now. bad things happen even in relationships built on faith. hindi talaga maiiwasan ang away at tampuhan. disagreements and misunderstandings are part of being human. i failed to handle some of those moments properly. i became complacent and assumed you would always stay. i did not realize how dangerous that mindset was. for that, i take full responsibility. i am deeply sorry.
i am sorry for the pain i caused you. i am sorry for the moments when i failed to listen. i am sorry for the times i did not protect your heart. i promised you that i would treat you right. i promised you that i would never make you cry. looking back, i see where i failed those promises. that truth weighs heavily on me. i regret that i took your presence for granted. i wish i had been more careful.
please know that despite my failures, i was trying my best. my efforts may not have been perfect or enough. still, they were real and sincere. i loved you in the ways i knew how at the time. i acknowledge that love alone is not always enough. actions matter, and consistency matters. i lacked in areas where i should have been stronger. i accept that without excuse. learning this has been painful but necessary.
there are moments i will forever cherish. the happy memories remain vivid in my mind. the midnight calls we shared meant more to me than you know. our long chats and constant updates brought comfort to my days. those moments felt safe and genuine. they were simple but meaningful. even now, those memories stay with me. they are reminders of what once was.
sometimes, i find myself missing those quiet routines. not just the conversations, but the feeling of connection. there was comfort in knowing someone cared. there was peace in sharing small details of the day. those moments grounded me. they made ordinary days feel lighter. i never forgot how that felt. those memories are part of who i am now. they shaped me deeply.
i know that right now, things are different. i understand that it may be impossible for you to come back. i try to accept that reality with maturity. still, a part of me continues to hope. not loudly, but quietly and patiently. hope does not always mean expectation. sometimes, it simply means faith. that is what i hold onto now. a quiet and respectful hope.
i am sorry that even after months, i have not fully let go. i know this may seem selfish or unreasonable. my heart simply has not learned how to stop caring. my love for you was genuine from the beginning. i never used you for comfort or attention. i never played with your feelings. my intentions were always clean and sincere. that truth remains unchanged.
i am aware that you have someone else now. i respect that reality and your choices. i know this letter may come at an inconvenient time. still, i wanted to speak honestly. this is not meant to interfere with your life. it is only meant to express what i have carried. i believe honesty is better than silence. especially when feelings are real. that is why i am writing this now.
i once told you that if there was someone else, i would stop. at the time, i truly believed i could keep that promise. i thought strength meant walking away without looking back. but honesty requires me to admit otherwise. my heart did not follow logic or plans. it held onto you quietly. i do not fully understand why. i only know that the love remained.

i loved you deeply, in a way that changed me. it was not loud or dramatic, but steady and sincere. loving you made me more aware of myself. it taught me patience and vulnerability. it showed me parts of my heart i had never explored. that love did not disappear when things ended. it stayed, even when it hurt. it stayed, even when it was inconvenient.

you were once my home, and i mean that sincerely. home is not just a place but a feeling of safety. with you, i felt understood and accepted. i felt like i could rest emotionally. you made me feel like i had someone to lean on. that kind of comfort is rare. it is not easily replaced. that is why it stayed with me.

people often ask why i liked you. the answer has never been simple. yes, you are beautiful, and that is true. but beauty alone was never enough to hold my heart. i was drawn to your personality and your presence. the way you talked to me mattered deeply. the way you listened made me feel seen. those things meant more than appearances ever could.

believe it or not, i was genuinely happy when i was with you. happiness did not come from grand gestures. it came from calm moments and shared silence. everything felt lighter and more peaceful. being with you brought balance to my life. stress faded when we talked. worries felt smaller when you were there. that feeling has stayed with me.

i still hope that one day, you might come back. i say that without expectation or demand. hope does not mean entitlement. it simply means faith in possibilities. i know how foolish that may sound. but my feelings were never built on pride. they were built on sincerity. that is why they endure.

i know i sound like a fool at times. vulnerability often looks that way from the outside. but everything i have said is true. i never lied to you then or now. honesty has always mattered to me. even when it is uncomfortable. even when it hurts. i would rather be honest than pretend. that is why i continue to speak from the heart.

every day, you remain in my prayers. not just as a habit, but with intention. i pray for your health and well being. i pray that life treats you kindly. i pray that you find peace in whatever path you are on. your happiness matters to me deeply. even if i am not part of it. those prayers are sincere and constant.

i also pray for a second chance. not because i feel entitled to one. but because i believe growth deserves opportunity. i believe mistakes can be corrected with humility. i believe people can learn and change. i wanted the chance to prove that. i wanted to do things right this time. that desire comes from reflection and regret. not from ego.

still, i do not force you or pressure you. i am aware of your current situation. i respect your space and your choices. this letter is not a request or an ultimatum. it is simply an expression of truth. you owe me nothing in response. your silence would still be respected. my intention is only to be honest.

i want you to know that my door remains open. not as a trap, but as a reassurance. if you ever choose to return, you would be welcomed with care. there would be no resentment or pride. only understanding and patience. i would choose you again with more wisdom. that promise comes from growth. not from desperation. it is grounded and sincere.

if not now, then maybe one day. i believe that paths cross for reasons we do not always understand. timing has its own language. sometimes, distance teaches lessons closeness could not. sometimes, separation allows healing to happen. i trust that God sees what we cannot. i trust his timing more than my own. that faith keeps me grounded.

i truly believe that God separates people for a reason. not always as punishment. sometimes, it is preparation. maybe it is to help us become stronger individually. maybe it is to teach us lessons we ignored before. maybe it is to refine our character. i hold onto the belief that nothing is wasted. even pain has purpose. that belief comforts me.

i hope that during this time, you are focusing on yourself. i hope you are taking care of your heart and mind. i hope you are prioritizing your studies and future. you deserve stability and growth. you deserve peace and clarity. whatever you are working toward, i hope it succeeds. your well being has always mattered to me.
as i write, i choose honesty above all else. my heart has not moved forward. it has not sought anyone else. time has passed, yet my feelings remain. i am not looking for a replacement. i am not distracted by others. my love for you has remained true.

i remember the moments we shared with clarity. the midnight calls, the laughter, and quiet conversations are still vivid in my mind. no one else has ever made me feel the way you did. you were my comfort, my peace, and my home. even now, the thought of you brings warmth to my heart. i do not want anyone else. my heart has always belonged to you.

i have learned much from the time apart. it has taught me patience and reflection. i have understood the value of care and consistency. even in mistakes, i have found lessons to grow from. these lessons only make my hope stronger. they remind me why i cannot settle for anyone else. they remind me why it has to be you.

i know that life moves in ways we cannot control. timing is unpredictable, and paths diverge. yet, i believe that God has reasons for everything. if it is meant for us to return to each other, it will happen. until that moment comes, my heart remains loyal to you. i will wait with patience and faith. i will never look elsewhere.

every day, you remain in my prayers. i pray for your health, your safety, and your happiness. i pray that you are surrounded by peace and guidance. i pray for clarity in your life and in your decisions. i pray for protection over your heart. even though we are apart, my care has never faltered. my love has only grown stronger with distance.

i do not write this to pressure you. i do not ask for immediate answers or responses. i only wish to share the truth of my heart. i want you to know that my love has never wavered. i want you to know that my commitment was always sincere. i do not pretend, and i do not deceive. every word here is the truth.

thinking of you brings both joy and longing. joy for the love we shared, longing for what we could still have. i remember the moments when everything felt calm around you. i remember how safe and understood i felt. those feelings were genuine and real. they are not memories i can replace. they are not feelings i can redirect.

i cannot imagine my life with anyone else. my heart will not accept substitutes. the love i have for you is unique and irreplaceable. it is rooted in connection, trust, and understanding. it is built on shared experiences and sincerity. it cannot be transferred or given to someone else. it exists only for you.

even with mistakes in the past, my hope remains. i know what i failed at and what i can do better. i know that growth is required for love to thrive. i am willing to improve and change for us. i am willing to learn patience, humility, and care. i am willing to correct what was wrong. i am willing to wait for you.

i know it may seem impossible sometimes. distance, time, and circumstances can feel overwhelming. yet, my heart refuses to let go. my hope refuses to fade. i believe in what we could still be together. i believe in second chances when love is true. i believe in us, faithfully.
i am aware that waiting is not easy, and loving quietly requires strength. there are days when hope feels heavy, yet i still carry it. i do not wait because i have nothing else. i wait because my heart knows what it wants. choosing you was never accidental. it was intentional and sincere. that intention has never changed.

sometimes i ask myself why my heart stayed this way. the answer is always the same. you made me feel understood in ways no one else ever did. you gave me peace without asking for anything in return. being with you felt natural and safe. that kind of connection does not fade easily. it leaves a permanent mark on the heart.

i do not believe that love should be rushed or forced. i believe it should be chosen freely and willingly. that is why i never pressure you. i respect your space and your journey. still, my heart quietly hopes you find your way back. hope does not mean control. it simply means faith in what once felt right.

even now, i imagine how different things could be if given another chance. i imagine loving you with more patience and care. i imagine choosing understanding over pride. i imagine protecting your heart the way it deserved. these thoughts are not fantasies. they are commitments i would keep. they come from growth and reflection.

i know that mistakes cannot be erased. i do not wish to pretend they never happened. instead, i carry them as reminders of what not to repeat. i believe people can grow when they are honest with themselves. i believe i have grown because of what we went through. that growth belongs to you as much as it belongs to me. it exists because loving you mattered.

there is no one else i compare you to. there is no one else i imagine a future with. my heart does not wander or look back and forth. it stays where it feels at home. that place has always been with you. even in silence, even in distance. that truth has remained steady.

i accept that love sometimes requires patience longer than expected. i accept that timing does not always align with desire. still, i trust that God sees what we cannot. i trust that he understands my heart completely. if reunion is part of his plan, it will come gently. until then, i remain faithful in waiting.

there are moments when memories surface unexpectedly. a song, a quiet night, or a familiar feeling brings you back to my thoughts. these moments are not painful. they are reminders of something real. they remind me that loving you was not a mistake. they remind me that my heart was capable of something genuine.

i do not regret choosing you. even with the pain, i would choose you again. love always involves risk, but it also brings meaning. you brought meaning into my life. you changed the way i see love and commitment. that impact remains with me. it is something i hold with gratitude.

my prayers for you have never stopped. i pray not only for happiness, but for peace and clarity. i pray that you feel supported in everything you do. i pray that you are guided in your decisions. even if i am not part of your present, i care deeply about your future. that care is unconditional.

even with distance, my heart remains steady. it does not look elsewhere for comfort. it does not seek replacement or distraction. you are the one it has chosen. that choice has not wavered. even when circumstances feel hard, my hope stays alive. i trust in the truth of my feelings.

every morning reminds me of what i truly value. it reminds me of the connection we shared. it reminds me why my heart cannot let go. i think of your smile, your voice, and your presence. even the smallest memories feel meaningful now. they are proof of what was real between us. they are proof of why i am still here.

sometimes it feels lonely to wait, but it is worth it. waiting does not mean losing hope. it means believing in what matters most. my heart has learned patience because of you. it has learned that true love is steady. it has learned that absence does not erase care. it has learned that only you can hold this place in my heart.

i hope you know that my love has never been conditional. i do not love you for convenience or appearance. i love you for who you are, for your heart, and for the moments we shared. no one else can fill that space. my love is anchored in sincerity and commitment. it has remained unchanged through time. it has remained true to you alone.

i think often about what it would mean if you returned. i imagine caring for you with greater wisdom. i imagine cherishing your heart with more care. i imagine making up for past mistakes without repeating them. i imagine us building something stronger together. these thoughts are not fantasies; they are intentions. they are prayers for a chance to love you rightly.

even in quiet moments, i feel your presence in my heart. your laughter, your words, and your kindness echo in memory. it reminds me of why i cannot give up. it reminds me of why no one else can replace you. the love we shared was genuine and deep. it has left a mark that nothing else can erase. it continues to shape the way i feel and hope.

i know that timing may be uncertain. i know that life does not always align with desire. yet, my heart remains unwavering. i trust that if it is meant for us, God will guide us back. i do not rush his plans, but i remain faithful. i continue to hope quietly and patiently. my love does not waver with distance.

i have no intention of giving my heart to anyone else. it has already chosen and it will not choose again. you are the only one it wants. you are the only one it has ever been committed to. my loyalty has never wavered. my commitment has never faltered. even time and distance have not changed that. it remains yours.

thinking of you brings both hope and patience. hope for a possible reunion and patience to wait for it. i do not demand or rush you. i only wish to express the truth of my heart. my love is quiet but strong. my hope is steady and unwavering. it is a love that has been tested and proven faithful.

i cannot imagine sharing my life with anyone else. my heart has been faithful to you alone. no one can take your place in my thoughts or feelings. you are the one who made my heart feel at home. even in silence, your presence lingers. even in absence, my commitment remains. it has never wavered and it never will.

i think about the future often, and it always leads me to you. i imagine moments of laughter, of care, and quiet companionship. i imagine building trust and understanding together. i imagine being more patient and attentive. i imagine proving that my love can be gen -->
  <p>
I don’t know how to put everything into words, but I just wanted you to know that some feelings never fade — they just learn how to stay quiet. This letter isn’t meant to ask for anything. It’s simply here to remind you that somewhere, someone still cares in the softest way. If the universe ever finds a way to bring things back together, I hope we’re both stronger when that day comes.
